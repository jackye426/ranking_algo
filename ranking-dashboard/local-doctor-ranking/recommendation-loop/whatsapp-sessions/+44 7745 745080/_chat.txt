[2/10/26, 18:43:46] ~Laura: Can you help me find the right specialist?
[2/10/26, 18:43:47] DocMap: Hi, thanks so much for reaching out.

We help connect people with trusted women’s health specialists, including doctors, dietitians, therapists, and physiotherapists. Someone from our team will be in touch shortly.

In the meantime, it would really help if you could let us know:
•	the type of specialist you’re looking for
•	your location
•	whether you have any insurance

If this is a medical emergency, please contact 999 (or your local emergency services) immediately.

Please note that we don’t provide medical diagnoses or medical advice.
[2/11/26, 13:05:19] DocMap: Hey there, just wanted to check and see if you would like to provide the above information and we can get the test started!

Worcester 
No
[2/11/26, 21:37:38] DocMap: Thanks for sharing these information. 

To help find the right specialist for you, can you tell us a bit more about your specific situation, such as the procedures you are looking for, your symptoms or anything else you’d like to look for in a specialist.
[2/11/26, 21:37:59] ~Laura: For endometriosis excision surgery
[2/11/26, 21:40:07] DocMap: Just to make sure we recommend the right surgeon — have you been told whether your endometriosis is deep or involves the bowel, bladder, or other organs, or is it considered mild/moderate?
[2/11/26, 21:40:17] ~Laura: Yes and mild
[2/11/26, 21:41:39] DocMap: Understood, and lastly are you happy to travel up to about an hour from Worcester if it means seeing a more experienced excision specialist?
[2/11/26, 21:41:47] ~Laura: Yes
[2/11/26, 21:42:47] DocMap: Ok, bear with me as I fetch your results. ~15 mins
