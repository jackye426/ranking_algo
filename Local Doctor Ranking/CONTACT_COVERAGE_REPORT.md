## Technical Details

### Data Structure

- Emails are stored in top-level `email` field or within `locations` array
- Records can have multiple sources (merged records)

### Analysis Methodology
- Each record is counted once per source it belongs to
- URL coverage checks for non-empty, non-null URL values in source-specific keys
- Email coverage checks both top-level and location-level email fields
