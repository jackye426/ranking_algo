[2/11/26, 12:43:46] ~Megan: Can you help me find the right specialist?
[2/11/26, 12:43:47] DocMap: Hi, thanks so much for reaching out.

We help connect people with trusted women’s health specialists, including doctors, dietitians, therapists, and physiotherapists. Someone from our team will be in touch shortly.

In the meantime, it would really help if you could let us know:
•the type of specialist you’re looking for
•your location
•whether you have any insurance

If this is a medical emergency, please contact 999 (or your local emergency services) immediately.

Please note that we don’t provide medical diagnoses or medical advice.
[2/11/26, 12:44:03] ~Megan: Endometriosis, with Devon and no insurance
[2/11/26, 12:44:30] DocMap: Thanks for sharing these information. 

To help find the right specialist for you, can you tell us a bit more about your specific situation, such as the procedures you are looking for, your symptoms or anything else you’d like to look for in a specialist
[2/11/26, 12:44:41] ~Megan: Endometriosis excision and management
[2/11/26, 12:46:13] DocMap: Have you been diagnosed with deep or complex endometriosis (for example involving the bowel, bladder, or nerves), or is this your first surgical opinion?
[2/11/26, 12:46:42] ~Megan: I have been diagnosed with deep infiltrating endometriosis
[2/11/26, 12:47:58] DocMap: Thanks for confirming it’s deep infiltrating endometriosis — that’s really helpful.

Just to make sure we match you with the right level of specialist, do you know whether it involves the bowel, bladder, ureters, diaphragm, or nerves?
[2/11/26, 12:48:17] ~Megan: Ureters
[2/11/26, 12:49:03] DocMap: Thanks — ureter involvement is really important to know.

Because this usually requires a highly specialised surgeon (often working with urology), it can sometimes mean travelling to a tertiary centre.

How far would you be willing to travel for the right specialist?
[2/11/26, 12:49:41] ~Megan: Any amount
[2/11/26, 12:50:02] DocMap: Understood. Bear with me as I fetch your results. ~15 mins
[2/11/26, 12:59:38] DocMap: Based on your diagnosis of deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the ureter, we’ve shortlisted five highly experienced excision surgeons with tertiary-level expertise, and it’s worth noting that Mr Minas, Mr Griffiths, Mr Tsepov and Mr Raza are all frequently featured on online endometriosis community recommendation lists.
