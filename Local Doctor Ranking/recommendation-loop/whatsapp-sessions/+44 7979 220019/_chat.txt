[2/11/26, 10:16:39] ~Raph 🪲: I’m looking for a endometriosis specialist excision surgeon, for a laparoscopic surgery, who takes on NHS patients
[2/11/26, 10:22:49] DocMap: Ok, and just to check, are you hoping to see the surgeon through the NHS pathway, or are you open to a private consultation if the surgeon also holds an NHS post?
[2/11/26, 10:23:54] ~Raph 🪲: Ideally would like to get an NHS referral to a private surgeon but open to a private consultation
[2/11/26, 10:25:02] DocMap: Understood. Are there any limits to how far you’d be happy to travel, or consultation fee range you’d like me to keep in mind?
