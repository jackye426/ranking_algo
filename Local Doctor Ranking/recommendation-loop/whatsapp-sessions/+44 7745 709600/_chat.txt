[2/11/26, 18:05:16] ~Chelsie: Can you help me find the right specialist?
[2/11/26, 18:05:19] DocMap: Hi, thanks so much for reaching out.

We help connect people with trusted women’s health specialists, including doctors, dietitians, therapists, and physiotherapists. Someone from our team will be in touch shortly.

In the meantime, it would really help if you could let us know:
•the type of specialist you’re looking for
•your location
•whether you have any insurance

If this is a medical emergency, please contact 999 (or your local emergency services) immediately.

Please note that we don’t provide medical diagnoses or medical advice.
[2/11/26, 18:05:19] DocMap: Thanks so much for your message — we’ve got it 😊

We’re just outside our working hours (09:00-18:00), but one of us will get back to you as soon as we’re back online.

In the meantime, it would help to know your location, whether you have insurance, the type of specialist you’re looking for, and anything else you’d like us to be aware of.

If this is urgent or a medical emergency, please contact 999 (or your local emergency services) straight away.

Speak soon.
[2/11/26, 18:08:46] ~Chelsie: Hello, I live in Wales Monmouthshire but will be moving to Bristol. I am with Benenden Health and I am looking for an endometriosis specialist and physio specialising in pelvic floor, in the Bristol region for when I move. Thank you for your help
[2/11/26, 18:45:33] DocMap: Hi there! Thanks so much for sharing 😊 Just to help us narrow this down properly — are you looking for a surgeon for possible excision surgery, or mainly ongoing management? And have you had a confirmed diagnosis (laparoscopy/MRI), including any bowel or bladder involvement?
[2/11/26, 18:46:56] ~Chelsie: Ongoing management please, I was diagnosed with Endo March 2025 via a laparoscopy and my bowel and bladder both had endometriosis one them! Mainly on my bowel
[2/11/26, 18:49:32] DocMap: Ok, are you mainly looking for symptom control and monitoring, or would you like to stay under a specialist who manages complex bowel endometriosis long-term in case you ever need further surgery
[2/11/26, 20:18:52] ~Chelsie: Symptom control and monitoring please
[2/11/26, 20:41:08] DocMap: Understood. Bear with me as I retrieve your results. ~15 mins
[2/11/26, 21:11:39] DocMap: Hi — thank you again for sharing the details of your diagnosis. Based on your bowel involvement and your preference for ongoing management rather than surgery, we’ve shortlisted a few experienced endometriosis specialists in Bristol who regularly manage complex cases and provide long-term follow-up.

Just to note, we’re not able to confirm Benenden recognition directly, so it would be worth checking with them to confirm which consultants are covered under your specific policy.

We weren’t able to find a pelvic floor physiotherapist in our current database with a clear endometriosis-focused profile in Bristol, we will look into expanding our dataset on this.
