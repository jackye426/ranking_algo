[2/11/26, 18:57:21] ~Leah McGeorge: Can you help me find the right specialist?
[2/11/26, 18:57:22] DocMap: Hi, thanks so much for reaching out.

We help connect people with trusted women’s health specialists, including doctors, dietitians, therapists, and physiotherapists. Someone from our team will be in touch shortly.

In the meantime, it would really help if you could let us know:
•the type of specialist you’re looking for
•your location
•whether you have any insurance

If this is a medical emergency, please contact 999 (or your local emergency services) immediately.

Please note that we don’t provide medical diagnoses or medical advice.
[2/11/26, 18:57:43] ~Leah McGeorge: Endometriosis, Northumberland, no
[2/11/26, 18:58:13] DocMap: Thanks for sharing these information. 

To help find the right specialist for you, can you tell us a bit more about your specific situation, such as the procedures you are looking for, your symptoms or anything else you’d like to look for in a specialist
[2/11/26, 18:59:09] ~Leah McGeorge: I have endometriosis, diagnosed via laparoscopy, I would like help with the bloating, nausea and fatigue I experience
[2/11/26, 19:02:31] DocMap: Thanks for sharing this — just a couple of quick questions so I can match you properly:

Are you mainly looking to see a gynaecologist (endo specialist), a gastroenterologist, or more of a dietitian/symptom-management approach?

Are you hoping to explore further surgery, or mainly improve symptoms non-surgically?
[2/11/26, 19:03:27] ~Leah McGeorge: I'm mainly looking for a symptom-management approach
[2/11/26, 19:05:40] DocMap: Got it — when you say symptom-management, are you thinking more of:

• a gynaecologist who specialises in medical (non-surgical) endometriosis care
• a gastroenterologist to investigate the bloating and nausea further
• or a dietitian/nutrition-led approach?

That will help me narrow this down properly for you.
[2/11/26, 19:07:51] ~Leah McGeorge: A gastroenterologist I think
[2/11/26, 19:09:39] DocMap: That makes sense — just to check, are your bloating and nausea mainly worse after eating or fairly constant regardless of meals?
[2/11/26, 19:11:13] ~Leah McGeorge: They're linked more to my menstrual cycle than to eating
[2/11/26, 19:13:12] DocMap: Thank you — that’s helpful. If your symptoms are more linked to your cycle rather than meals, it may be more appropriate to see a gynaecologist who specialises in medical (non-surgical) endometriosis management rather than a primary gastro route. Would you be open to that?
[2/11/26, 19:13:34] ~Leah McGeorge: Yes
[2/11/26, 19:14:58] DocMap: Ok, and last question, is there a limit to how far you’d be happy to travel or consultation fee you’d like me to keep in mind?
[2/11/26, 19:15:34] ~Leah McGeorge: I'd be will to travel within the UK fee wise £300 or less
[2/11/26, 19:16:54] DocMap: Understood. Bear with me as I retrieve your results. ~15 mins
[2/11/26, 19:17:01] ~Leah McGeorge: Great thank you
