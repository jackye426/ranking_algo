To begin, think of yourself as a patient searching for care, it can be based off your own experience looking for a specialist for endometriosis.

Why he may be a good fit:
Leads a BSGE-accredited endometriosis referral centre with explicit experience in deep infiltrating and diaphragmatic endometriosis, and routinely works within multidisciplinary surgical teams.

[2/9/26, 22:18:45] DocMap: 2) Michael Adamczyk
📍 The Lister Hospital (HCA) | In-person
Consultant Gynaecologist – Endometriosis & Neuropelveology

Why he may be a good fit:
One of very few UK surgeons with formal neuropelveology training, making him particularly strong for sciatic/nerve endometriosis alongside high-volume excisional surgery.

[2/9/26, 22:18:57] DocMap: 3) Andrea Bille
📍 London Bridge Hospital (HCA) | In-person
Consultant Thoracic Surgeon

Why he may be a good fit:
Thoracic surgeon with VATS/robotic expertise and a stated interest in diaphragmatic endometriosis, making him highly relevant for suspected thoracic or pulmonary endometriosis. He would typically be involved alongside a lead endometriosis gynaecologist, not as a standalone consultant.

Best for:
Confirmed or suspected thoracic/pulmonary endometriosis as part of a combined gynae–thoracic MDT pathway.

[2/9/26, 22:20:08] DocMap: Do you think these results are accurate and fit your needs?
[2/9/26, 22:32:48] ~Michelle Dewar 💛: Yes they are very good doctors
[2/9/26, 22:37:19] ~Michelle Dewar 💛: However I would only recommend BSGE accredited. With extensive endometriosis. If the other doctors work alongside the first one then yes, otherwise no. I have has a BSGE accredited surgeon for the last 18 years and my honest suggestion would be to only recommend BSGE surgeons when endometriosis is extensive.
[2/10/26, 11:12:40] DocMap: Thank you for this Michelle! 

I definitely agree that BSGE surgeons are essential for extensive endometriosis.

But is BSGE certification alone be enough to deal with thoracic or pulmonary endometriosis?
[2/10/26, 11:14:16] DocMap: Can you spend 15 minutes with us chatting with us about your experience using our tool?
