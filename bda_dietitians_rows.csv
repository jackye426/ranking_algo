More and more people are living long and healthy lives with diabetes. Let’s work together to make a plan for a healthier you. Invest in your future, invest in your health.
Hello, I am Antoinette Goodwill and I am passionate about helping people living with diabetes through lifestyle changes. I have worked for more than 10 years as a diabetes dietitian in the NHS. During this time I have worked as a non-medical prescriber which helped me have a better understanding of diabetes medication. Overall, I have more than 20 years of clinical experience working in the NHS in various specialities. This enables me to have a holistic approach to provide food and lifestyle choices to suit people's overall health.
Through the years, working as a registered dietitian within the NHS, I have seen what a big difference food and activity can have on diabetes. It is truly inspirational! Even small daily changes to your routine can make a big difference to your blood glucose levels and overall health, no matter what treatment you are taking for your diabetes. That is why I feel strongly that everybody with diabetes should be offered the opportunity to talk to a registered diabetes dietitian. Unfortunately, this is not always possible due to NHS resourcing constraints. If you do not have access and want more support, please contact me.

I currently work at the University of Oxford where I investigate how nutrition can help prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. My particular interest is how nutrition can help manage type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk independent of weight loss. This is important to have as an option because many of my patients don't want to or find it difficult to lose a lot of weight. 
In fact, even if people don't lose weight, there are ways to use nutrition to lower blood sugars, blood pressure and cholesterol. Of course, if people also want to lose weight, very often these effects can be additive. 
My clinical studies and experience working in glucose regulation and insulin resistance has also given me considerable expertise in managing polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), reactive hypoglycaemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
I also spent 5 years working in the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, which specialised in appetite regulation. Therefore, I also counsel patients for weight management with a focus on utilising foods for their role in satiety and fullness.

I specialise in supporting families and individuals with a history of trauma, including domestic abuse, and helping children and teenagers navigate the complexities of eating disorders, particularly those stemming from adverse childhood experiences.
Having personally experienced the struggles of an eating disorder, I intimately understand the isolating, confusing, overwhelming, and frightening nature of these conditions. However, I also firmly believe in the transformative power of recovery, I believe very strongly that 100% recovery is possible. 
My career is dedicated to guiding individuals and families toward eating disorder recovery. I primarily work with busy moms, young children, and teenagers, crafting personalized treatment interventions that address the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of eating disorders. My approach is rooted in the Intuitive Eating framework, body image healing, and weight-inclusive, trauma-informed care.

I actively engage with primary and secondary schools to implement prevention programs that educate on eating disorders, raise awareness of warning signs, and empower educators to support their students effectively.

At the heart of my practice lies a commitment to creating a safe, non-judgmental space for my clients. I encourage achievable, accessible health behaviors and genuine self-care, shifting the focus away from numbers on the scale and toward holistic well-being.

I have a wide range of experience in adult clinical dietetics and worked as the lead specialist oncology dietitian for 11 years at Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Northwood. 

Since 2011, after completing training on the low FODMAP diet at King’s College, London, I started using this approach to treat IBS patients.  The low FODMAP diet is a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates which has been shown to be effective in improving symptoms of IBS.

Working closely with gastroenterologists and oncologists, I provide high quality care for all patients and maintain up to date practice through continuous professional development- attending regular workshops, short courses and meetings. I strive to provide excellent standards of dietetic care and improve patient outcomes.

Some of the principal treatments carried out include:

Cancer and palliative care
Gastroenterology disorders, including IBS, coeliac disease and diverticular disease
Nutritional support including patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
Weight management, pre diabetes and type 2 diabetes (not on insulin)

I specialise in being able to provide high quality, evidence based, tailored advice.  After a detailed consultation, exploring your individual needs, eating pattern and lifestyle, I will provide summary notes of the consultation and liaise with your consultant or GP, as appropriate.

I'm Nadia, a registered dietitian and nutritional therapist, with a First Class Bsc in Nutrition and Dietetics, and a Diploma in Nutritional Healing (N.H.F. Dip). I work with clients with a wide range of conditions, but have a special interest in helping people live better with chronic gut and neurological conditions, in particular Parkinson's. I have a practice in Bristol and on line, based on the naturopathic principles of treating each person as a whole, and focusing on allowing the body's natural ability to heal itself. 
Before training in Nutrition and Dietetics I had spent many years as a professional cellist. Sadly, this career was cut short by hand and shoulder problems which turned out to be a forerunner to Parkinson's Disease. The diagnosis left me feeling isolated and let down by my body. But, I was determined to do as much as I could to help myself, and regain control of my health, as far as possible, with nutrition. By combining a predominantly plant based diet, optimisation of hydration, dramatically increased specialised exercise, and nutritional healing principles, I've managed to keep the Parkinson's in check. I've been able to lead a full and fulfilling life, and still have none of the obvious appearances of the disease. So, I haven't found a quick fix, but my experience of determined, long term commitment to an appropriate dietetic and nutritional healing approach shows the possibility of mitigating the effects of chronic disease, in ways that traditional medicine might not be able to. 
I am committed to helping people reclaim their health and get to a place where they are thriving. I believe my personal experience greatly enhances my ability to help you develop the necessary powerful can-do mindset which, together with healthy eating habits, has the potential to transform your health for life, not just in the short term.

She graduated cum laude with an Honours degree in Dietetics and obtained a MSc in Eating Disorders with distinction from University College London (UCL). She has almost 20 years of experience working with people of all ages in both the NHS and in private practice. She was the lead eating disorders dietitian for London’s largest NHS eating disorder service for 7 years and left the NHS to focus on her private practice and her family. 

She specialises in all types of eating disorders, weight management, fertility and pregnancy and sees patients from age 13 years either face to face in her rooms in Hampstead and Finchley (North London) and also offers virtual appointments.  
 
Aleeza believes that everyone can achieve a healthy weight and a healthy relationship with food. Her mantra is ‘beautifully balanced in body and mind’ and has empowered thousands of patients including models, actresses, politicians and professional football players with the knowledge and tools to regain control of their eating, achieve a healthy weight and optimise their physical and mental wellbeing by adopting a balanced lifestyle. She combines her extensive clinical knowledge with a person-centred approach that ensures you are listened to and supported in a confidential and judgement-free environment
Some people eat when they are not hungry as a way of coping with anxiety, stress, low mood and just out of habit. Other people reward themselves with food. Aleeza’s unique skillset which combines dietetics and behavioural psychology will enable you to understand not only what you are eating but why you are eating and teach you alternative coping strategies to manage these emotions that don’t affect one’s health or weight.
 
Although she studied in London she is born and bred in sunny South Africa and hasn’t lost her South African warmth, humour (and accent). She will challenge your eating disorder head-on whilst being compassionate, empathetic and non-judgemental and will be your greatest cheerleader when you achieve your goals, regain control and find true food freedom.
 
She is registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and the British Dietetic Association (BDA). She is also a member of the BDA’s Mental Health Interest Group; the London Eating Disorders Dietetic Group and the BDA’s Maternal and Fertility specialist group.

474ac1da-474a-4580-9cc0-c1123f8f926b,Louise Symington,,Hove United Kingdom,,"Hello, I’m a Registered Dietitian with over 15 years experience in NHS, private practice and the charity sector. My background includes running GP clinics (covering child allergies through to weight management) catering and food policy work at charities such as The National Trust and product development at brands such as Cradle and Bloom. I’ve also advised at government level working on DEFRA’s Green Food Project.
How I can help you
I know that changing eating habits can sometimes be hard. This is why I ensure my advice fits in with my clients lifestyle and budget. I empower people to make positive changes for themselves – rather than ‘dictating’ what they should or shouldn’t do. Building a healthy relationship with food is also very important but sometimes overlooked. If we enjoy our food we are much more likely to sustain changes. This is something I can explore in sessions if it interests you.
Given my background in sustainability, I can also offer expert advice on the ethical side of food (welfare, fair trade, carbon footprint) as well as vegetarianism and veganism too.
I work in Brighton, Hove, Portslade and beyond.","Agriculture & Farming, Articles, Books, Business consulting, Catering, Charitable sector, Conferences, Consumer Press, Cooking demos, Education & Academia, Event Management, Events, Food, Food Security, Food Technology, Functional and Interactive Medicine, History, Lecturing & teaching, Marketing Research, Media / PR, Marketing / Advertising, Product development, Nutrition technical expertise, Policy, Private practice, Public Health & Food Policy, Radio, Recipe & menu analysis, Recipe development, Research & Development, School Health, Social media, Content Creation, Speaking, Surveys, Trade Journals, Tradeshows and Exhibits, Television, Web, Workplace nutrition, Writing and editing","Food legislation & composition, Food policy, Food security & sustainability, Food services (all sectors), Freelance Practice, Public health, Veganism and Vegetarianism, Women's health, Working with the media, Workplace health","Europe, International, Ireland, UK",https://www.bda.uk.com/find-a-dietitian/louise-symington-hove-united-kingdom-5871.html

My specialised services encompass diabetes management during pregnancy, tailored nutritional guidance for type 1 or type 2 diabetes, professional recommendations for reducing blood glucose levels, nutritional counselling for heart health, cholesterol, and blood pressure, as well as recipe modifications to promote healthier eating habits.
My love for food and science ignited long before pursuing a career as a dietitian. While still in high school, I delved into the culinary world by taking on a part-time role at a quaint restaurant in North Wales, where I assisted chefs with fundamental food preparation. I then went onto work in another two restaurants, earning a NVQ in food preparation and catering along the way. This experience laid a solid groundwork for mastering culinary essentials like crafting soup from scratch using a roux, developing rich meat stocks, and flawlessly frying eggs during bustling breakfast shifts.
While thriving in the culinary world, I realised my yearning for the scientific and health aspects of food. After six years in the culinary realm, I made the decision to retire my chef whites and focus entirely on pursuing a degree in nutrition and dietetics.

I am Anna, a HCPC (Health & Care Professions Council) Registered Dietitian with working experience inside and outside the NHS. I started as a freelance dietitian with an interest to explore the role of nutrition for our medical and mental health, and overall quality of life. Also, how our nutrition education and behaviours shape our eating choices for future health and environmental preservation.

I moved on and continue to practice dietetics within the NHS with a special focus on weight management interventions, weight loss/Bariatric surgery, Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, Sleep Apnoea, Cardiovascular diseases, gut dysfunction, and mental health conditions. I have worked with special needs patients and my aim is to work using personalised approaches and behavioural change techniques to guide individuals through a healthier way of living.

I have worked in different hospitals in London to support the nutrition of adults and the elderly. I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge and practice in other clinical areas with main interests around gut health, women and early life health, and nutrigenetics. To achieve the best patient care, I believe one needs to combine clinical practice and strive for ongoing learning and development. I have participated in a few clinical research projects and small education roles and try to maintain up-to-date with nutrition research.

I currently offer remote telephonic or video consultations around:

• Weight loss
• Weight gain
• Metabolic / Bariatric Surgery

I believe that the right nutrition can play a crucial role in managing symptoms and significantly improving your quality of life.
I understand these challenges, not just professionally but also personally, as I have lived experience with MCAS and histamine intolerance. This personal insight gives me a unique empathy and understanding for those navigating these complex conditions.
Histamine intolerance and MCAS can show up in many ways, including:
Gastrointestinal issues: bloating, diarrhoea, stomach pain, and nausea
Skin reactions: hives, itching, and flushing
Respiratory problems: nasal congestion, sneezing, and difficulty breathing
Neurological symptoms: headaches, dizziness, and fatigue
Cardiovascular symptoms: rapid heart rate and low blood pressure
I’m here to help you understand these symptoms and manage them effectively through nutrition. I offer personalised consultations online and in Nottingham, where we can work together to create a nutrition plan tailored specifically to your needs. You can find more information on my website, The Dietary Edit.
My approach is holistic. Alongside nutrition, I incorporate lifestyle changes, stress management, and other complementary therapies to support your overall well-being. I’m dedicated to creating customised nutrition plans that fit your unique needs and preferences. To tell you a bit more about my background,
My training includes the low FODMAP diet at Monash University and food chemical sensitivities at The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia.

Perhaps you're finding yourself down internet rabbit holes and need a helping hand out?
Is it finally time to get that IBS under control? Or, are you simply in a rut with your diet and lifestyle? Have you spent years looking after everyone else but yourself and would like some gentle guidance and coaching, to put the focus back on you and your quality of life?
I would be delighted to support you.
My goal is for you to feel better informed and in control of your diet and health?
I qualified in 2005 and have supported clients as an NHS dietitian in leading teaching hospitals in London and Brighton, including within specialist diabetes units and over 10 years in specialist kidney units.
I also have a private practice and facilitate workshops with medical students.

As a Registered Dietitian with 10 years of experience and a deeply compassionate approach, I support people of all genders to improve their health and feel better in their bodies.
My work centres on helping clients with conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, adenomyosis, Hypothalamic Amenorrhea, thyroid conditions (Graves' Disease and Hashimoto's), and a wide range of complex fertility challenges - including recurrent miscarriage, unexplained infertility, and male-factor infertility. I support individuals and couples at every stage of the fertility journey, whether you're trying to conceive naturally, going through IVF, or managing hormone-related conditions alongside fertility concerns.
I also work extensively with people experiencing gut issues, including IBS, bloating, food sensitivities, and other functional gastrointestinal disorders. I offer a non-restrictive, practical approach that focuses on improving symptoms while helping you build a nourishing, enjoyable relationship with food.
In addition, I work with clients navigating complex, long-term health conditions such as MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome) and long COVID. I understand how fluctuating energy, food sensitivities, and medical complexity impact everyday life. My approach is always empathetic, flexible, and led by you.
I bring additional lived experience to supporting clients with PCOS, IBS, Graves’ disease, and long COVID. Having personally navigated these conditions, I know how physically and emotionally exhausting they can be. This insight allows me to offer compassionate, realistic support that’s adaptable to the ups and downs of chronic health issues.
While weight loss may be part of your goals, it’s never the only focus—often not the primary one. My aim is to help you feel better in your body, improve symptoms, and build habits that last. I work collaboratively to create tailored, evidence-based plans that honour your lived experience, values, and long-term health.
I’m inclusive of all identities and work with people of all genders, including trans, non-binary, and cisgender clients. Together, we create personalised, evidence-based plans that support your goals, values, and lifestyle—because lasting change comes from working with your body, not against it.

Hi,
I'm Rebecca, a dietitian specialising in intuitive eating, body image, mindfulness and gut health (IBS).
I offer an, embodied, compassionate and trauma sensitive approach to finding peace with food and self. Here are some ways I can help:
Intuitive Eating: This is a holistic and evidence based framework that helps people to break free of diet culture, of bouncing between restrictive and binge eating, of viewing body weight as a dominant marker of health and happiness.
Instead I help to empower people to cultivate body appreciation, develop self- awareness, compassion and maybe even self-love. I work with people to better navigate their emotional landscape, build trust in themselves and their body and to recognise internal signals such as hunger and fullness. We work not just to repair their relationship with food but also with self and others too.
Gut Health (IBS): I help people who have 'functional gut disorders' such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) to find relief from symptoms. My approach involves recognising the possible root causes of the condition and symptoms, and addressing these to find long lasting peace.
While it is possible to find some relief through short-term elimination diets, they are often not appropriate and may ultimately worsen a person's condition or relationship with food. Instead I spend most of my time supporting people through a multi-dimensional approach that covers:
- Gentle Nutrition
- Mind
- Embodiment
- Rest
A little more about me:
I am LGBTQIA+ and neurodiversity affirmative in my work and aim to support inclusivity. I aim to work both with cognitive (mind) and somatic (body) based therapeutic models targeting the root cause of problems and supporting long lasting change.

I help people who struggle with their relationship with food to breakthrough complex health challenges and eat well for better physical and mental health. 
Drawing on over 30 years' experience in the NHS and private practice I have particular expertise in mental health, eating disorders, extreme picky eating in young people and adults, the gut/brain connection and helping people achieve and maintain a healthier weight. 
My practice is rooted in my values:
Credibility - everything I do is based on the best scientific evidence coupled with over 30 years of learning from my patients' lived experience.
Acceptance - I will accept you where you are on your journey to better health without judgment. Feelings of shame can be a huge barrier to people seeking help with their eating. I aim to put you at ease so that you can be open and get the help you really need.
Responsiveness - no one wants to wait weeks for support and answers to their questions. I offer rapid response coaching so that you can get the help and reassurance you need in a timely way.
Empathy - I seek to understand how you are feeling so that I can provide sensitive and compassionate support and just the right amount of challenge to help you move forwards.
I founded my private practice Eating Mindset to help people move away from:
Unhelpful thinking and behaviours associated with eating and body image distress;
Emotional eating;
Ways of eating that cannot be sustained long-term;
Self-blame and shame.
And move towards:
Eating for joy as well as health;
Enjoying food socially;
Understanding the broader benefits of food for a well-functioning body and mind;
A healthier weight and better overall health and functioning.

I’m Maria Kolotourou, a registered dietitian with over 20 years of experience. Based in the UK, I offer online nutrition services for anyone looking to take their nutrition to the next level, optimise their intake, and support their overall wellbeing.
My approach is holistic, rooted in the deep connection between body and mind. I believe that truly caring for ourselves begins with reconnecting to our bodies -carefully listening and understanding its real needs. Nutrition plays a vital role in this process, not just as a source of energy, but as a powerful tool for self-care, balance, and overall wellbeing.
My philosophy is based on the principles of Intuitive Eating and the Mediterranean Diet. I have a special interest in women’s nutrition across life stages, and through my many years of experience, I’ve developed expertise in supporting people struggling with chronic dieting and emotional eating.
Together, we will work on this journey of reconnection, helping you meet your nutritional needs, enjoy food without guilt, and find the weight that’s right for your body.
If you’re ready to shift your mindset around food and reconnect with your body in a kinder, more compassionate way… welcome aboard!","Private practice, Digital Health","Coaching/ mentoring, Digital healthcare, Eating disorders, Freelance Practice, Low FODMAP, Maternal mental health, Maternity, inc. maternal obesity, Mental health, Obesity, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), Research, Women's health, IBS, Menopause","Europe, UK",https://www.bda.uk.com/find-a-dietitian/maria-kolotourou-yourgreekdietitian-knaresborough-united-kingdom-19035.html

This is for you if:
- You can't stop thinking about food ALL THE TIME and it's getting draining
- You try so hard to eat healthy but have moments where you feel OUT OF CONTROL around food
- You jump between diets and meal plans but nothing really sticks
- You worry if you eat when you are hungy you will NEVER STOP EATING
- You're just done with feeling OBSESSED WITH FOOD

This is NOT a diet or meal plan. 
Instead you are supported to:
- Using CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) you naturally shift your thoughts so food is not on your mind ALL THE TIME
- Using mindfulness techniques you develop connection with your body's innate hunger and fullness so healthy eating comes naturally
- Learn the types of foods your body needs to feel truly satisfied so out-of-control emotional eating and binge eating will ease
- Understand your nervous system (stress and emotion) and recognise what emotions you are feeling so food can be comforting but you are also able to cope without food
- Eat food that provides your body the nutrition it needs as well as joy, comfort, pleasure, culture, memories and social experiences.

I have 11+ years experience working in diabetes. I am Australian and started my career helping pregnant Aboriginal women in outback Australia. I loved it so much and this developed my passion towards diabetes. 

In 2012 I moved to the UK and worked in the National Health Service (NHS) specialising in diabetes and antenatal diabetes services, meanwhile studying a masters in public health and completing post graduate courses on fertility and pregnancy.

I left the NHS in 2021 as I felt burnout and frustrated. I hated the restriction of having only 10 minutes to help Mums with Gestational Diabetes and I knew I WANTED TO DO MORE! 

I saw a close friend of mine really struggle with gestational diabetes. I was able to help her so much so she could still enjoy her pregnancy and found this so so rewarding. 

Many women I work with COME TO ME feeling so lost, overwhelmed and stressed. No wonder, when there is so much conflicting advice around! This all makes navigating gestational diabetes alone so confusing. 

I now dedicate my career to help mums so they can learn how to balance blood sugars while still ENJOYING pregnancy.

Following registration with the Health Care Professions Council (HCPC) I started working in district general hospital. After a few years working in a range of specialities I joined a childhood obesity programme called MEND (Mind Exercise Nutrition Diet) where we provided nutrition education and exercises to children and their families. Following on from this I moved to a community dietitian role designing and rolling out weight loss groups in GP surgeries. Whilst in the community I managed weekly community clinics working with people with bowel disorders, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, malnutrition and a range of other problems. I then had the opportunity to work in the local haemodialysis unit and eventually moved to work in the Exeter Renal Unit. My role here allowed me to be involved as a committee member of the national Renal Nutrition Group, to present at national conferences, to be involved in setting up staff and patients weight management groups and to complete my Post Graduate Certificate in Advanced Practice with the University of Plymouth. More recently I have worked to build the Kidney Kitchen with Kidney Care UK and I continue to work in the NHS as a Primary Care Dietitian.","Recipe & menu analysis, Articles, Digital Health, Education & Academia, Lecturing & teaching, Private practice","Cookery/ recipe development & analysis, Diabetes, Diverticulosis, Freelance Practice, IBS, Obesity, Renal nutrition, Veganism and Vegetarianism",International,https://www.bda.uk.com/find-a-dietitian/laura-kyte-exmouth-united-kingdom-6378.html

I’m a registered dietitian and PCOS specialist, but I’m also someone who has PCOS—so I know first hand how frustrating it can be to try everything (cutting carbs, taking inositol, following TikTok trends) and still feel out of control.

When I was diagnosed, even with over a decade of experience in nutrition, I struggled with irregular periods, acne, fatigue, and weight gain. The only advice I got? “Just lose weight or go on the pill.” It wasn’t enough—and it definitely wasn’t supportive. So I went deep into the research, experimented, and developed an approach that truly worked.

Now, I help other women with PCOS do the same through my 12-week Thrive with PCOS program. Using my evidence-based NOURISH framework, we work together to regulate your cycle, reduce symptoms, and restore hormonal balance—without extreme diets or guilt.

My approach combines:
✔ Personalised nutrition and supplement advice
✔ Lifestyle and mindset support
✔ Cycle tracking and education
✔ Gentle accountability and intuitive eating principles

You’ll finally stop Googling conflicting advice, feel confident in your choices, and break free from diet culture—for good.

I started my journey into nutrition while living in California, USA, where I became passionate about food for health and qualified as a coach. Wanting to learn more about nutrition, health and disease, I studied at and graduated from the University of Surrey with a First class Bachelor's degree.

I have over 5 years' experience in NHS and private healthcare specialising in gastrointestinal disorders with advanced FODMAP training from King’s College London. It always brings me great pleasure to see the impact dietary changes have on improving symptoms and quality of life. 
I take on private clients 1:1, both online or at my clinic in Wokingham. I am also recognised with several health insurance providers and with stool testing companies.

Writing is another passion of mine, and I have had articles published in several magazines for healthcare professionals, and worked for food companies, writing many posts on diet and nutrition. With my love for teaching, I have been honoured to guest lecture at Oxford Brookes University.

I love to not only help people improve their relationship with food, but also their relationship with themselves. I’m positive and kind and with my training in motivational interviewing and behaviour change, I’m able to explore an individual’s priorities and ascertain the goals they want to achieve and strategise how to get there.

I realised during my engineering career that I am a people person and that I want to help people who were struggling to manage their health. Hence, I took a brave decision to change my career to become a Dietitian on 2003.
I am HCPC registered and a member of BDA professional bodies. I have achieved master level qualifications to be specialised in Paediatric dietetics and eating disorders. I am highly experienced as a Paediatric Dietitian specialising in food allergies, food intolerances, restricted diet (in the context of ASD, ADHD, Eating disorders, ARFID), sensory diet, feeding difficulties, faltering growth/nutritional deficiencies, constipation, reflux and support with artificial nutrition, tube feeding including NG/PEG/JEJ feeding. I am passionate about children’s health and their well-being. I strongly believe that supporting a child’s growth physically and mentally is very vital for their future stability and development.
I have extensive experience of working in a variety of settings within the NHS and I have grown in my passion and experience to help children. I have worked with children from infants to young adults up to 18 years old for over 8.5yrs and with adults for about 7yrs . I have had multiple opportunities to communicate and deal with a diverse range of patients and their carers who may be suffering with neurological conditions, genetic disorders, metabolic disorders or learning difficulties, causing them to have serious speech difficulties and/or behaviour challenges. As a result I have incredible communication skills that I can use with parents, carers, school staff and children to ensure I empower them to make a difference.
In addition I bring wealth of knowledge and experience from multiple cultures of South Asia. I was born in India and have been in the UK for 25yrs, I speak multiple languages including Hindi, Urdu, Marathi, Marwadi, English and understand Gujarati, Punjabi. In my personal life I have first-hand experience of looking after a child who has ADHD and multiple learning difficulties, and this has been challenging but rewarding helping him grow to a healthy young adult. I love cooking and enjoy exploring new dishes. I am a bubbly, happy, friendly and a positive person.
I hope I can help you and your child to make a difference in their nutritional health. I am very much looking forward to working with you and your child. 🙂","Private practice, Business consulting, Education & Academia, Health screening","Adolescence, Coaching/ mentoring, Early years nutrition, Eating disorders, Food allergy, Freelance Practice, Paediatric - Nutrition Support, Paediatrics","East Midlands, UK, International, Scotland",https://www.bda.uk.com/find-a-dietitian/sonali-gandhi-bachchakinutrition-childrens-nutrition-leicester-united-kingdom-6883.html

I specialise in supporting women struggling with disordered eating patterns- such as restrict-overeat cycles, binge eating, or feeling controlled by cravings- as well as those navigating digestive and hormone imbalances, fertility concerns, PCOS, and menopause.
HOW WE'LL WORK TOGETHER
I combine nutrition science with evidence-based behaviour change strategies to help you build realistic, sustainable eating habits. By addressing both practical steps and mindset shifts, we’ll work together to uncover the root causes of unhelpful patterns.
YOUR MIND
Knowing what to do is only part of the equation. Emotional triggers, ingrained habits, and the influence of diet culture can keep women stuck in cycles of guilt, shame, and restrictive or comfort eating. Together, we’ll explore the thought patterns behind these behaviours and develop healthier ways to respond to challenges- helping you build confidence and long-term flexibility around food.
YOUR BODY
Through a thorough assessment of your health and lifestyle, I provide personalised recommendations to better hormone balance, support fertility, and improve gut health- among many other areas. We’ll consider factors like nutrition, exercise, stress management, and sleep, tailoring everything to your unique needs.
YOUR JOURNEY, OUR COMMITMENT
In our one-on-one sessions, you’ll receive compassionate, personalised support to help you move toward the change you desire. My goal is to offer practical, down-to-earth guidance, without unnecessary tests or rigid meal plans.
